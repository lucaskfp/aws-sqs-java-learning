## Setting the default credentials

Select one of these options to set the default credentials:
- Set credentials in the AWS credentials profile file on your local system, located at:
  - ~/.aws/credentials on Linux, macOS, or Unix
  - C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.aws\credentials on Windows

This file should contain lines in the following format:



```

```
